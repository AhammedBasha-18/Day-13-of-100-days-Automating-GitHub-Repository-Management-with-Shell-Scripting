# Day-13-of-100-days-Automating-GitHub-Repository-Management-with-Shell-Scripting
In the ever-evolving world of DevOps, automation is a cornerstone for efficiency and scalability. On Day 13 of the 100DaysOfDevOps challenge, we dive into a hands-on project that integrates shell scripting with the GitHub API. This project simplifies managing repository access, a critical aspect of organizational DevOps practices.

Whether youâ€™re a DevOps novice or an aspiring engineer, this blog will provide a comprehensive walkthrough of the project, offering insights into API interaction, shell scripting, and best practices for automation.

Key Concepts in GitHub API Integration
Understanding the GitHub API
APIs enable seamless communication between software applications. The GitHub API is particularly powerful for automating repository tasks such as managing access, fetching repo details, and monitoring changes programmatically.

Why Shell Scripting?
Shell scripting automates repetitive tasks, reducing manual intervention and increasing accuracy. By using tools like curl and jq, we can create efficient scripts to interact with the GitHub API.

The Project: Automating Repository Access Management
Objective: To write a shell script that lists all users who have access to a specific GitHub repository.

Tools Used:

Shell scripting (Bash)
GitHub API
curl (for API requests)
jq (for parsing JSON responses)
