# Day-13-of-100-days-Automating-GitHub-Repository-Management-with-Shell-Scripting
In the ever-evolving world of DevOps, automation is a cornerstone for efficiency and scalability. On Day 13 of the 100DaysOfDevOps challenge, we dive into a hands-on project that integrates shell scripting with the GitHub API. This project simplifies managing repository access, a critical aspect of organizational DevOps practices.

Whether you’re a DevOps novice or an aspiring engineer, this blog will provide a comprehensive walkthrough of the project, offering insights into API interaction, shell scripting, and best practices for automation.

Key Concepts in GitHub API Integration
Understanding the GitHub API
APIs enable seamless communication between software applications. The GitHub API is particularly powerful for automating repository tasks such as managing access, fetching repo details, and monitoring changes programmatically.

Why Shell Scripting?
Shell scripting automates repetitive tasks, reducing manual intervention and increasing accuracy. By using tools like curl and jq, we can create efficient scripts to interact with the GitHub API.

The Project: Automating Repository Access Management
Objective: To write a shell script that lists all users who have access to a specific GitHub repository.

Tools Used:

Shell scripting (Bash)
GitHub API
curl (for API requests)
jq (for parsing JSON responses)






Step-by-Step Walkthrough
Setup GitHub Personal Access Token

Generate a token with appropriate permissions (like repo and admin:org).
Keep it secure, as this token will authenticate API requests.
Constructing API Calls

Use curl to interact with the GitHub API endpoint for collaborators:
bash
Copy code
curl -H "Authorization: token <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>" https://api.github.com/repos/<ORG>/<REPO>/collaborators  
Parsing JSON Responses with jq

Extract and format relevant information, such as collaborator names and permissions:
bash
Copy code
curl -H "Authorization: token <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>" https://api.github.com/repos/<ORG>/<REPO>/collaborators | jq '.[] | {login: .login, permissions: .permissions}'  
Creating the Script

Build a script with user prompts for repository and organization input.
Include functions for making API calls and formatting responses.
Add error handling to check for valid inputs and API responses.
Enhancing Usability

Add a helper function for usage guidance:
bash
Copy code
function show_help() {  
    echo "Usage: ./script.sh <ORG_NAME> <REPO_NAME>"  
}  
Test and Debug

Run the script with test repositories.
Refine it based on output and edge cases.
Key Learnings
Automation Saves Time
By automating access management, DevOps teams can focus on more strategic tasks.

APIs Are Powerful
Understanding API interaction is a fundamental skill for DevOps engineers.

Iterative Improvement
Real-world projects often require iterative testing and enhancement.

Conclusion
By integrating shell scripting with GitHub’s API, we’ve taken a significant step toward mastering DevOps automation. This project not only sharpens your scripting skills but also introduces you to practical API management—a vital tool in the DevOps toolkit.

Let’s continue building, learning, and automating!
